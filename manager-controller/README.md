# Manager Controller

![Context Diagram](https://github.com/randysimpson/othello/raw/master/context.PNG "Context Diagram")

## Description

The solution-generator containers will register with the manager-controller containers.  Then the solution-generator containers will be used to generate all possible outcomes of the Othello board play, and send the solved solutions to the manager-controller containers for processing/storage.  The manager-controller is used to send the data to the postgres database and store the solution's unigram count/bigram count while keeping the wins/loss/tie statistics.  The intent behind using microservice architecture is that multiple API calls can be issued and received simultaneously speeding up the time it takes to process all possible solutions.

## Issues

1. The microservice's were not running async, which needed to be investigated.
2. Microservices need throttled somehow so that all 10^28 possible states are not sent out in http calls simultaneously
3. Unclear how big the database would need to be.
