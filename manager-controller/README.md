# Manager Controller

![Context Diagram](https://github.com/randysimpson/othello/raw/redis/context.PNG "Context Diagram")

## Description

The solution-generator containers will check for visited states from the redis read only databases.  The solution-generator is used to generate all possible outcomes of the Othello board play, and send the solved solutions to the master-controller containers for processing/storage.  The manager-controller is used to send the data to the redis read/write database and store the solution's child parent relationships.  The intent behind using microservice architecture is that multiple API calls can be issued and received simultaneously speeding up the time it takes to process all possible solutions.

## Issues

1. The microservice's were not running async, which needed to be investigated.
2. The space in the redis database will run out before all outcomes are achieved.
