# Othello Server

Create a game server that can accept REST API calls to perform actions for the players.  The server will send a webhook to signal when it is the next players turn.  The goal is to allow containers to be setup to test the AI capabilities and record the game history and scores.  From the past games statistics and charts can be examined to determine the best approaches.
