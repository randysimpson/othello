# Othello Greedy Client

*Python*

This AI client will choose an option from the list of available options that maximizes the score after the game state is applied.  The current game state and color are received from the body of the REST API endpoint.  This app was created to create an opponent that has minimal ability to get an advantage.

# Installation

## Manual

To install the client download the `main.py` file from the github repo:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/randysimpson/othello/master/greedy/main.py
```

Run the client, and the port exposed is `9000`:

```
python main.py
```

## Docker

To run this from docker issue:

```sh
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 randysimpson/othello:1.0-greedy-latest
```

## Test

To test the client:

```sh
curl -d '{"id":2,"creationDate":"2019-11-15T23:02:51.857Z","player1":{"name":"rsimpson","color":"X"},"player2":{"ip":"othello-greedy-ai","port":9000,"color":"O"},"status":{"message":"Waiting for Player 1","date":"2019-11-15T23:02:51.857Z","player":{"name":"rsimpson","color":"X"},"score":{"player1":2,"player2":2},"availableActions":[[3,5],[5,3],[4,2],[2,4]]},"state":[[" "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "],[" "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "],[" "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "],[" "," "," ","X","O"," "," "," "],[" "," "," ","O","X"," "," "," "],[" "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "],[" "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "],[" "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "]],"history":[]}'-H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:9000/api/v1/ai
```

# REST API Endpoints

* `/api/v1/ai`

   * `POST` - Used to evaluate the logic of a game state and return a random available option.  The expected body is `Content-Type: application/json` with the following syntax:

   ```
   {
        "id": 3,
        "creationDate": "2019-11-14T23:25:11.137Z",
        "player1": {
            "ip": "localhost",
            "port": 9000,
            "color": "X"
        },
        "player2": {
            "ip": "localhost",
            "port": 9000,
            "color": "O"
        },
        "status": {
            "message": "Waiting for Player X",
            "date": "2019-11-14T23:25:11.658Z",
            "player": {
                "ip": "localhost",
                "port": 9000,
                "color": "X"
            },
            "score": {
                "player1": 2,
                "player2": 2
            },
            "availableActions": [
              [3,5],
              [5,3],
              [4,2],
              [2,4]
            ]
        },
        "state": [
          [" "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "],
          [" "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "],
          [" "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "],
          [" "," "," ","X","O"," "," "," "],
          [" "," "," ","O","X"," "," "," "],
          [" "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "],
          [" "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "],
          [" "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "]
        ],
        "history": []
  }
   ```

   Response body if successful will have the following syntax:

   ```
   {
     "player": {
       "ip": "localhost",
       "port": 9000,
       "color": "X"
     },
     "location": [2,4]
   }
   ```
